Lab Exercise 7
1.  Write a Python program to read first n lines of a file.
2. Write a Python program to append text to a file and display the text.
3. Write a Python program to read a file line by line and store it into a list.
4.  Write a program to print each line of a file in reverse order.

7: Subtract a week ( 7 days)  from a given date in Python
8: Add week ( 7 days) and 12 hours to a given date
Given:
# 2020-03-22 10:00:00
given_date = datetime(2020, 3, 22, 10, 0, 0)
Expected output:
2020-03-29 22:00:00

9: Print ten dates, each two a week apart, starting from today, in the form YYYY-MM-DD.

10: Calculate number of days between two given dates
Given:
# 2020-02-25
date_1 = datetime(2020, 2, 25)
# 2020-09-17
date_2 = datetime(2020, 9, 17)
Expected output:
205 days

b) Current year in full
c) Month of year full name
d) Weekday of the week
e) Day of year
