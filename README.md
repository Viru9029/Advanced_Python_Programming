Lab Exercises 5 (Based on Modules, Packages & File handling)


Q55. Write a Python program to read an entire text file.
 

Q56. Write a program that counts lines and characters in a file. With your favorite text editor, code a Python module called mymod.py, which exports three top-level names: a) A countLines(name) function that reads an input file and counts the number of lines in it b) A countChars(name) function that reads an input file and counts the number of characters in it c) A test(name) function that calls both counting functions with a given input filename. All three mymod functions should expect a filename string to be passed in. Now, test your module interactively, using import and name qualification to fetch your exports. 


Q57. Test your mymod module from Exercise 2 interactively, by using from to load the exports directly, first by name, then using the from* variant to fetch everything. 


Q58. Now, add a line in your mymod module that calls the test function automatically only when the module is run as a script, not when it is imported The line you add will probably test the value of __name__ for the string "__main__", as shown in this unit. Try running your module from the system command line; then, import the module and test its functions interactively.
 

Q59. Write a second module, myclient.py, which imports mymod and tests its functions; run myclient from the system command line. If myclient uses from to fetch from mymod, will mymod’s functions be accessible from the top level of myclient? What if it imports with import instead? Try coding both variations in myclient and test interactively, by importing myclient . 


Q60. Package imports. Finally, import your file from a package. Create a subdirectory called mypkg nested in a directory on your module import search path, move the mymod.py module file you created in exercises 2 or 4 into the new directory, and try to import it with a package import of the form: import mypkg.mymod. 


Q61. Experiment with module reloads: perform the tests in the changer.py example, changing the called function’s message and/or behavior repeatedly, without stopping the Python interpreter. Depending on your system, you might be able to edit changer in another window.

Lab Exercise 8:
Q75: Follow the steps:
•	Create a class, Triangle. Its __init__() method should take self, angle1, angle2, and angle3 as arguments. Make sure to set these appropriately in the body of the __init__()method.
•	Create a variable named number_of_sides and set it equal to 3.
•	Create a method named check_angles. The sum of a triangle's three angles is It should return True if the sum of self.angle1, self.angle2, and self.angle3 is equal 180, and False otherwise.
•	Create a variable named my_triangle and set it equal to a new instance of your Triangle class. Pass it three angles that sum to 180 (e.g. 90, 30, 60).

Q76: Define a class called Songs, it will show the lyrics of a song. Its __init__() method should have two arguments:self and lyrics.lyricsis a list. Inside your class create a method called sing_me_a_song that prints each element of lyricson his own line. Define a varible:
happy_bday = Song(["May god bless you, ",
                   "Have a sunshine on you,",

Q100.In cryptography, a Caesar cipher is a very simple encryption techniques in which each letter in theplain text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with ashift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. The method is named after JuliusCaesar, who used it to communicate with his generals. ROT-13 ("rotate by 13 places") is a widely usedexample of a Caesar cipher where the shift is 13. In Python, the key for ROT-13 may be represented bymeans of the following dictionary:key = {'a':'n', 'b':'o', 'c':'p', 'd':'q', 'e':'r', 'f':'s', 'g':'t', 'h':'u', 'i':'v', 'j':'w', 'k':'x', 'l':'y', 'm':'z', 'n':'a', 'o':'b','p':'c', 'q':'d', 'r':'e', 's':'f', 't':'g', 'u':'h', 'v':'i', 'w':'j', 'x':'k', 'y':'l', 'z':'m', 'A':'N', 'B':'O', 'C':'P', 'D':'Q', 'E':'R','F':'S', 'G':'T', 'H':'U', 'I':'V', 'J':'W', 'K':'X', 'L':'Y', 'M':'Z', 'N':'A', 'O':'B', 'P':'C', 'Q':'D', 'R':'E', 'S':'F', 'T':'G','U':'H', 'V':'I', 'W':'J', 'X':'K', 'Y':'L', 'Z':'M'}Your task in this exercise is to implement an encoder/decoder of ROT-13. Once you're done, you will beable to read the following secret message:Pnrfne pvcure? V zhpu cersre Pnrfne fnynq!Note that since English has 26 characters, your ROT-13 program will be able to both encode and decodetexts written in English.
